[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S598GzSND1o)

Cyberbowl is a university game project from my Bachelor degree that I've worked on together with 2 other programmers and 3 artists over the course of 6 months.

Key points:
* Unreal Engine 4.25
* 4 Player split-screen
* Third Person View
* heavily 'inspired' by Rocket League, but with Tech-Mages
* Modular Gameplay Tutorial
* Options Menu
* fmod integration for audio
* Cyberpunk-like aesthetics
